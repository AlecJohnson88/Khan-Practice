    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Approximately 12-24 before planned cook time, fill large bowl with water and a large sprinkle of salt. Mix water and salt until salt disappears. Add pork butt to water ensuring that the water covers the meat completely. Cover in plastic wrap and place in fridge.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bring BBQ pit up to temperature of 225-250 degrees. While pit is warming, remove pork butt from brine and wash completely under cool water. Pat dry and set aside. Melt stick of butter in microwave and inject melted butter throughout pork butt. Sprinkle sweet rub over entire pork butt and cover generously. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place pork butt in pit and maintain temperature. After a few hours, check internal temperature. When internal temp reaches 165 degrees, wrap in aluminum foil with <strong>shiney side facing inward</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Continue to monitor internal temperature. Remove from pit when internal temperature reaches <em>200 degrees</em>. Let rest for 1 hour in foil.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Shred with fork and serve on buns.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Bring pit to temperature of 225-250 degrees</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While pit warms, remove ribs from packaging, pat dry, and trim off any extra fat or small bones.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When pit is at correct temperature, place ribs on middle of rack with <em>bone side down</em>.</p>
    </body>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Maintain temperature until ribs are dark on outside and the meat has drawn up on the bones. To test if meat is done, twist bones gently. If the bones can twist in the meat, the ribs are done and ready to be removed.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Allow meat to rest for 15 minutes. Cut in between bones and serve.</p>
